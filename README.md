This C program reads an integer `N` from the user and then prints out `N * 2`.

It uses `scanf` to take the input, where `&N` provides the address of the variable `N` so the input value can be stored there. Then, it uses `printf` to output the result of `N` multiplied by 2, followed by a newline. The program ends by returning 0, indicating successful execution.
